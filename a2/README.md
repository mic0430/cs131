This is useful beacuse it can perform common tasks that allow users to read and summarize their files.

How can I use this command:
This command is easy to use, we just need to have our files as input, then we exexecute commands with specific file, it will execute tasks for you.

For example, I have "HelloWorld\n123\n456" as my exampl4, I just have to type -sand the file name (example4.txt), it will give me word count =3, line count =3, character count = 18, and number count = 6.
  

If I only want to know  the number of lines only, I can do
./a2shellscript.sh -l example4.txt
It will give me 3.

If I only want to know the count of the number, I can do
./a2shellscript.sh -a example4.txt
It will give me 6.

If I want to get the content of the file printed out, I can do
./a2shellscript.sh -p example4.txt
It will print out 
HelloWorld
123
456
